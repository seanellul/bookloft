# Book Loft - Cayman Humane Society

A Flutter-based inventory management system for Cayman Humane's Book Loft, designed to help volunteers manage book donations and sales efficiently.

## Overview

Book Loft is a volunteer-run book loft that accepts donated books and resells them for $2-5 each. This app digitizes their operations while maintaining their volunteer-driven approach, providing:

- **Barcode/ISBN Scanning**: Quick book identification using mobile camera
- **Inventory Management**: Track book quantities, donations, and sales
- **Search Functionality**: Find books by title, author, or ISBN
- **Offline Support**: Works even in areas with poor connectivity
- **Transaction Tracking**: Record donations and sales with dates and volunteer information

## Features

### üì± Core Functionality
- **Barcode Scanner**: Scan ISBN barcodes to quickly identify books
- **Book Lookup**: Automatic book information retrieval from Open Library API
- **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time quantity management
- **Search & Filter**: Find books by various criteria
- **Transaction History**: Track all donations and sales

### üîÑ Transaction Management
- **Donation Tracking**: Add books to inventory with date and volunteer info
